## <img src=".docs/label.svg" width="18px">&nbsp; About

This is a simple application developed with Expo using React Native. It aims to search for current weather data based on the user's coordinates.


## <img src=".docs/label.svg" width="18px">&nbsp; Layout

The layout was developed by me and was based on a minimalist, clean layout with only the necessary information the user.


## <img src=".docs/label.svg" width="18px">&nbsp; Run project

- This project was developed with Expo, so you need to have the expo installed globally on your machine: **`npm install expo-cli --global`** or **`yarn add expo-cli -g`**.

- With the expo installed, install the dependencies using the package manager of your choice: **`yarn`** or **`npm install`**.

- To search the API, you will need an access key, which can be generated by following the steps:
  - Access **[this](https://openweathermap.org/)** website and create an account with your email.
  - After creating an account, an access key will be sent to your email. Copy that key.
  - Access the folder **`src/config`** and create a file **`app.env.ts`** (use the base `app.env.example.ts` file) and insert your key in variable `openweather_api`.

- With the dependencies installed, run the server: **`yarn start`**, **`npm start`** or **`expo start`**;

- In the tab that opens in your browser, choose the option to view application:
  - **View on physical device:** Install the Expo app (or Expo CLI on Android) and scan the QR Code with your camera.
  - **View on emulator:** Install the Expo application on the emulator, and on the open tab after running the server, select the option: `Run on Android device/ emulator`.

  :warning: Remember that both devices(server and physical device) must be on the same network.
